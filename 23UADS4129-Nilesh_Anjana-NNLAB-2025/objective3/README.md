The code configures TensorFlow to use session-based execution, ensuring compatibility with TensorFlow 1.x operations.

It loads the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, normalizes pixel values to a 0-1 range, flattens each 28x28 image into a 784-element vector, and converts labels to a one-hot encoded format.

The dataset is divided into batches of 32 samples to facilitate efficient training and evaluation.

An iterator is created for both training and testing datasets to sequentially access batches during model training and evaluation.

A neural network model is defined with an input layer of 784 neurons, a hidden layer of 128 neurons with sigmoid activation, and an output layer of 10 neurons with softmax activation.

The model's performance is evaluated using a cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam optimizer is employed to adjust the model's weights and biases to minimize this loss.

The model is trained over 5 epochs, processing all training batches in each epoch and updating parameters to improve accuracy.

After training, the model's accuracy is assessed using the test dataset to determine its effectiveness in classifying unseen digit images.
